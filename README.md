#        Silly Sally        #
-----------------------------

This program only needs the concole. It also utalizes the windows API so not sure if that would cause
issues compiling with another OS. We have also noticed decreased framerates when some laptops are in 
power saving mode so that is something to note. We think it has been fixed with the more efficent frame 
output function. (orignially the whole frame was printed to screen every time but now only things that
move do.)


#       Win Condition       #
-----------------------------
The win condition will take you a long time and we had to cheat to test it. Its not that its impossible, just
that we didn't have the time to actually play it for that long. The game would need to run for 86 min to win.
The win condtion was made 36191 because that is the altitude in feet that Sally flew to this summer in New Mexico.
